## Alpha Update

#### 02/20/2023

It's been a couple of weeks since we last updated you on our progress, so here we are!

Our alpha testing build is live on [Itch](//holodash.itch.io/holodash)! We'll be updating our game frequently in the next couple of weeks as we get ready for the end of the quarter.

It's exciting to finally let everyone play our game, but it is also scary at the same time. We recently conducted "Big Merge 2.0", in which we merged all the features each member of the team has been working on into one build, during this process we ran into issues and bugs, but here's hoping those are resolved in the finalized alpha build.

We have some upcoming planned features that didn't make it in time for this alpha, but here's what you can look forward to seeing:

- The upgrade shop is missing actual upgrades, we're still workshopping upgrades that fit our design philosophy, but once we figure those out, we'll implement the upgrades.
- We're workshopping more augments and will make them drop at regular intervals during the run to make things more interesting!
- There'll be a main menu and a hub to hang out in before you start a run, this will also be where you upgrade your skills.
- New tiles for level, new sprites for player and enemies, boss AI, volume setting, setting menu in pause menu.

Please test our game out and leave us your feedback! We appreciate it lots.

Sincerely,
The HoloDash Team
