We're so excited to bring you the cinematic trailer for HoloDash.

We're even more excited to announce that we will be holding a public playtesting session this week on Thursday.

We have a Minimum Viable Product ready for you to test, but to say that it's "Mininum" would be a huge understatement.

Thanks to the hard work of Kyle, we are pround to present HoloDash's very own procedual level generation system.

A whole new world awaits you.

We'll see you there,

The HoloDash Team
