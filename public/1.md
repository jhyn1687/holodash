## Humble Beginnings

#### 01/04/2023

Hello and welcome to the first blog post for our indie game, HoloDash!

We are excited to announce that development has officially begun on our
new game, which is a cyberpunk themed roguelite. While we haven't
decided on a specific genre for the game yet, we can tell you that it
will be fast-paced and action-packed.

HoloDash runs will have procedually generated layouts and power-ups that
will make each playthrough feel unique. Players will be able to explore
through neon-lit streets, taking on challenging enemies and bosses as
they progress through the game.

We have only just begun development on HoloDash, but we are already hard
at work on bringing it to life. We will be sharing updates on our
progress as well as sneak peeks at gameplay and artwork in the future,
so stay tuned!

We can't wait for you to join us on this journey and be a part of
bringing HoloDash to life.

Sincerely,

The HoloDash Team
