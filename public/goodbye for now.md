## Goodbye... For Now

#### 03/13/2023

As the quarter comes to a close, so does our active development on HoloDash. This has been a fun ride for everyone on the team.

The Games Capstone convention was super fun, and it was great to have people play our game and give feedback immediately.

We're proud of what we created and if we had the time and resources, we would definitely build HoloDash to what we envisioned it to be.

But for now, we're signing off here. Thank you for coming along for our journey.

With Love,

The HoloDash Team
