_Hmm... He's falling out the window..._

Today, we held the first non-internal playtest for HoloDash. 
We got a lot of valuable feedback and will iterate on them before our public playtest on Thursday.

We're still working hard on polishing all aspects of our game, and what you see will continue to 
evolve.

We're working hard to bring you the upgrade shop, more assets to round out our worldbuilding, and 
adding more weapons and augments for you to slam together.

It's cheesy to say but to have the hard work we've been pouring our heart into for the last four 
weeks be seen by the world is scary, but we're so glad that our playtesters seem to enjoy the game
so far.

There's still so much more that we want to bring to you.

Be there or be square,

The HoloDash Team
