#### 01/25/2023

We're heading into week 3 of development, and we're ramping it up.

But first, a sneak peek at our main character!

*\[REDACTED\] has a nice ring to it, right?*

In the past week, we've been hard at work bringing HoloDash to life, we've been working on our movement system, our weapon system, and our augment system. We're also looking at potential ways to integrate some banging OST into our game, stay tuned!

We're still not quite ready to show what the game looks like yet, but as long as we keep moving smoothly, you'll be seeing some gameplay soon!

Sorry for the short update this week, that's it from us for now.

See you next week,

The HoloDash Team
