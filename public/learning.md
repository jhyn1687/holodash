## Learning

#### 02/08/2023

Over the past week, we've conducted multiple playtesting sessions. These sessions allowed us to gather tons of feedback. This has been a crucial part of the development process and has allowed us to iterate on many of the game's features.

Using the feedback from our first and second playtest, we've been able to make improvements to the gameplay mechanics, including the movement mechanics that we feel are the core of what makes our game feel smooth to play. We're still tweaking some numbers, but we're confident that these changes will make the game even more fast-paced and action-packed.

After making these changes, we conducted some more public playtests. Here are some of the feedback we received:

- The movement feels responsive.
- The enemies provide a good level of difficulty, but the AI could use some improvement, as they feel too predictable.
- Some players found the difficulty level too high, making the game feel frustrating at times.
- The game could benefit from more variety in the levels and environments.

We loved hearing these feedback, and we feel you, we also want the game to be the best it can be. So we'll continue to work on making the gameplay experience feel better.

In addition, we've been working on the progression loop of the game. Since we're a roguelite, we want the player to progress in skill, whether that's strict mechanical skill, or in-game upgrades that allows you to breeze through the earlier portion of the game.

We're so grateful for the feedback and support that we've received and we can't wait for you to experience the game for yourself. Thank you for your continued support and stay tuned for more updates on HoloDash!

Sincerely,

The HoloDash Team
