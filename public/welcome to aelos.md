## Welcome to Aelos

#### 01/13/2023

Notice anything different? That's right, HoloDash has a logo!

In addition to our logo, we've also been looking at the art direction for the game. We are carefully crafting and curating the visual style of HoloDash to ensure that it is not only aesthetically pleasing, but also true to the game's storyline. We are taking great care to make sure that the art direction is cohesive and consistent throughout the game. We don't have it down to a tee yet, but here's something to look forward to in the meantime.

*Feel the wrath of these enemies.*

We're also refining the story behind our game. Welcome to Aelos, the city of unity. Aelos is a city built by Visonine, a megacorporation that has its reach in all crevices of the city. No system runs without Visonine. Working for Visonine is something everyone aspires for. But don't fret, soon you too can become the employee of the year!

We know you're hungry for more, but that's all we can share for now. We'll have more info for you in our next development update.

Until next time,

The HoloDash Team
